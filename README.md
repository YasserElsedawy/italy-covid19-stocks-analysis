# italy-covid19-stocks-analysis

COVID-19 has changed our lives for good. The world is in a complete lockdown, and we had to make major changes to our lifestyles. The impacts of the virus is spreading, disrupting everyday life in Milan and everywhere else in the world, cutting shopping, disrupting global supply chains, real estate market and threatening the economy at large.

The stock market has had to deal with some drastic changes on its own. In this project, we will build a Python script to calculate the impact of Coronavirus on stock prices on the The Milan Stock Exchange. We will explore the performance of some of the biggest fashion companies on the market to see how good or badthey have stood against the COVID-19 storm. We will take as reference stock prices before the outbreak in Italy and compare it to the same stock prices a few weeks later until April 21st. We will be doing this by conducting differnt analysis and by computing daily price changes for multiple stocks using Python and Pandas. After, we will try to build a prediction model based on the relatioship between the stock prices and the daily numbers of coronavirus cases in Italy.

The companies under inverstigations are: Moncler, Aeffe, Brunello Cucinelli, Fila, Geox, OVS, Salvatore Ferragamo and Tod's.

Let's get started.
