# italy-france-covid19-stocks-analysis

COVID-19 has changed our lives for good. The world is in a complete lockdown, and we had to make major changes in our lifestyles. The impacts of the virus is spreading, disrupting everyday life in Milan and everywhere else in the world, cutting shopping, disrupting global supply chains, real estate market and threatening the economy.

The stock market has had to deal with some major changes on its own. In this project, we will build a Python script to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on stock prices regarding the Milan & Paris Stock Exchanges. We will explore the performance of some of the biggest fashion companies on the market to see how good or bad they have stood against the COVID-19 storm. We will take as reference stock prices before the outbreak in Italy and compare it to the same stock prices a few weeks later until April 21st. We will be doing this by conducting different analysis and by computing daily price changes for multiple stocks. After, we will try to explore the relationship between the stock prices and the daily new numbers of coronavirus cases in Italy.

The companies under inverstigations are: Moncler, Aeffe, Brunello Cucinelli, Kering, LVMH, Christian Dior, Salvatore Ferragamo and Tod's.

Let's get started.
